# Arhitecture
At the first stage I don't think it is good idea to make a lot arhitect planning,
because in comparison to Python C++ force you to make much more and most probably you will change it in future iterations,
so I made a simple MVP that  is not optimize  yet, but it will be much more interesting to make it automized with deveops tricky things than Python

# Code practices
Smart const-ness guarantees, strict type mutations, all this used practices make c++ code clean, 
optimized and understandable 

# Framework choice
Boost is not a framework actually, it is a set of libraries that are pretending to be included into STL library
I have used as it is most powerful tool in C++ so if boost is included you can do everything.
which most probably will make docker image easier to create
